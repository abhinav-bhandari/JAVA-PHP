fopen()


A better method to open files is with the fopen() function. This function gives you more options than the readfile() function.


fclose()


The fclose() function is used to close an open file.


We will use the text file, "webdictionary.txt", during the lessons:

        <?php
        $myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
        echo fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));
        fclose($myfile);
        ?>
    
Output:
