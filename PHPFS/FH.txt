File handling is an important part of any web application. You often need to open and process a file for different tasks.PHP has several functions for creating, reading, uploading, and editing files.

The readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.

Assume we have a text file called "webdictionary.txt", stored on the server, that looks like this:

        <?php

        /*file handling/
        echo readfile("webdictionary.txt");
        ?>
    
The readfile() function is useful if all you want to do is open up a file and read its contents.
