Form handling in PHP is a common way to collect user data and process it. Forms are created in HTML and can use two primary methods to submit data to a server-side script: the GET and POST methods. These methods differ in how they transmit data and how the server-side script accesses it:


GET Method:


1) The GET method appends data to the URL as query parameters.

2) Data is visible in the URL, making it suitable for non-sensitive information.

3) Data is limited in size due to URL length restrictions.

4) It is not suitable for passwords or other sensitive data because it's visible in the URL.

5) It is commonly used for search queries and navigation.


POST Method:


1) The POST method sends data in the HTTP request body.

2) Data is not visible in the URL, making it suitable for sensitive or larger data.

3) It is commonly used for submitting forms, such as login or registration forms.

4) It doesn't have the same size limitations as the GET method.

5) Here's an example of a simple HTML form that collects a username and password, then displays them on the same page using the POST method:
       

        <html>
        <head>
            <title>Simple Form</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h2>Simple Form Example</h2>
        
            <form method="post" action="">
                <label for="username">Username:</label>
                <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br><br>
        
                <label for="password">Password:</label>
                <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required><br><br>
        
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>
        
            <?php
            if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
                $username = $_POST["username"];
                $password = $_POST["password"];
                echo "<h3>Submitted Data:</h3>";
                echo "Username: $username<br>";
                echo "Password: $password";
            }
            ?>
        </body>
        </html>
