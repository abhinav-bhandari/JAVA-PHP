A PHP variable may have a name as long or short as you wish. It can consist of one letter (x, y, z, and so on) or a whole bunch of them (tree, household, thelongestwordinthewholewideworld).

The example below shows that the variable $text is a container to the value of Hey coders! and both $xand $y variables hold their respective values of 9 and 1.


EXAMPLE: Simple program to print “Hello world!” message on the screen.

        <?php  
           creating a variables
            $text = "Hey coders!";  
            $x = 9;
            $y = 1;  
        ?>

EXAMPLE: Simple program to create a "STRING" variable with message.

        <?php
        creating a variables
            $website = "bitdegree.org";  
            echo "I want to visit $website!";
            ?>
    
OUTPUT:

        I want to visit bitdegree.org
