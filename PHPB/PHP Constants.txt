PHP CONSTANTS 


A constant is simply a name that holds a single value. As its name implies, the value of a constant cannot be changed during the execution of the PHP script.

To define a constant, you use the define() function. The define() function takes the constant’s name as the first argument and the constant value as the second argument. For example:

        <?php 

        define('WIDTH','1140px');
        echo WIDTH;
        ?>


CONSTANTS KEYWORD 

PHP provides you with another way to define a constant via the const keyword. Here’s the syntax:

const CONSTANT_NAME = value;

FOR EXAMPLE :

            <?php

                const SALES_TAX = 0.085;

                $gross_price = 100;

                $net_price = $gross_price * (1 + SALES_TAX);

                echo $net_price; // 108.5
            ?>
