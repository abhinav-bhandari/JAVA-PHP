ADVANTAGES OF PHP:


1) It is supported by all Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.

2) It is integrated with other programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) and databased.

3) It is easy to connect with the database to store and retrieve data from the database. Multiple databases can also be integrated with PHP.

4) It is the fastest programming language compared to other programming languages.

5) PHP frameworks and tools are used to protect web applications from outer attacks and security threats.


DISADVANTAGES OF PHP:


1) Since PHP is open-source so its code is visible to all programmers. If any bugs exist in the source code then its weakness can be explored by other programmers.

2) It is not suitable for large applications because its maintenance is difficult.

3) The error handling of a PHP framework is not good.
