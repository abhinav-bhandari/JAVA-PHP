In PHP, a string is a sequence of characters. PHP provides you with four ways to define a literal string, including single-quoted, double-quoted, heredoc syntax, and nowdoc syntax. This tutorial focuses on the single-quoted and double-quoted strings.

To define a string, you wrap the text within single quotes like this:

        <?php 

        $title = 'PHP string is awesome';
        $title2 = "PHP string is awesome";

        echo '$title';
        echo '$title2';
        ?>
    
        PHP string is awesome
        PHP string is awesome

Accessing characters in a string

A string has a zero-based index. It means that the first character has an index of 0. The second character has an index of 1 and so on.

To access a single character in a string at a specific position, you use the following syntax:

$str[index]

FOR EXAMPLE :

            <?php
            $title = 'PHP string is awesome';

            echo $title[0];
            ?>
    
Output :

        P
    
Getting the length of a string

To get the length of a string, you use a built-in function strlen(), for example:

        <?php
            $title = 'PHP string is awesome';
            echo strlen($title);
        ?>
