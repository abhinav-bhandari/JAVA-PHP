In PHP, you can use string interpolation with curly braces to embed variables and expressions within double-quoted strings. This feature allows you to include the values of variables and evaluate expressions directly within the string. Here's how string interpolation with curly braces works in PHP:



Basic Variable Interpolation:


You can include variable values directly within double-quoted strings by wrapping the variable name in curly braces preceded by a dollar sign ({$variable}).

        $name = "John";
        $message = "Hello, {$name}!";
        echo $message; // Output: Hello, John!
    

Complex Expressions:


You can also evaluate complex expressions and include their results within the string using curly braces. The expression should be enclosed in {}.

$x = 5; $y = 3; $result = "The sum of {$x} and {$y} is {$x + $y}."; echo $result; // Output: The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.


Nested Curly Braces:


        $name = "Alice";
        $message = "Hello, {{$name}}!";
        echo $message; // Output: Hello, {Alice}!
     

Array Indexing :


You can interpolate array elements or object properties using curly braces as well.

        $person = ['name' => 'Alice', 'age' => 30];
        $message = "Hello, {$person['name']}! You are {$person['age']} years old.";
        echo $message; // Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
