When you place variables in a double-quoted string, PHP will expand the variable names. If a string contains the double quotes (“), you need to escape them using the backslash character(\). For example:

To define a string, you wrap the text within single quotes like this:

        <?php 
            $he = 'Bob';
            $she = 'Alice';
            $text = "$he said, \"PHP is awesome\".
            \"Of course.\" $she agreed.";
            echo $text;
        ?>
    
        Bob said, "PHP is awesome".
        "Of course." Alice agreed.


PHP Heredoc syntax:


The following shows the syntax of a heredoc string:

FOR EXAMPLE :

        
            <?php

            $str =<<<IDENTIFIER
            place a string here
            it can span multiple lines
            and include single quote ' and double quotes "
            IDENTIFIER;

            ?>
        
    
PHP heredoc strings’ use cases:


Getting the length of a string

To get the length of a string, you use a built-in function strlen(), for example:

        <?php
        
            $title = 'My site';
            $header = <<<HEADER
              

                <h1>$title </h1> 

                HEADER;
            echo $header;
        
        ?>
