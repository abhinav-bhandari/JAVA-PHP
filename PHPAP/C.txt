A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.


Create Cookies With PHP


A cookie is created with the setcookie() function.


Syntax:


setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);


Only the name parameter is required. All other parameters are optional.


PHP Create/Retrieve a Cookie:


The following example creates a cookie named "user" with the value "John Doe". The cookie will expire after 30 days (86400 * 30). The "/" means that the cookie is available in entire website (otherwise, select the directory you prefer).


We then retrieve the value of the cookie "user" (using the global variable $_COOKIE). We also use the isset() function to find out if the cookie is set:


        <?php
        $cookie_name = "user";
        $cookie_value = "John Doe";
        setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day
        ?>
        < html>
        < body>
        
        
        < /body>
        < /html>
