Arrays are complex variables that allow us to store more than one value or a group of values under a single variable name. Let's suppose you want to store colors in your PHP script. Storing the colors one by one in a variable could look something like this:

        
        <?php
            $color1 = "Red";
            $color2 = "Green";
            $color3 = "Blue";
        ?>
        
    
        Red
        Green
        Blue
