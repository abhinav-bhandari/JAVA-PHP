The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax:


while(condition is true) {
code to be executed if conditionis true
}



        <?php

        /* if statement*/
        $x = 1;

        while($x <= 5) {
          echo "The number is: $x 
";
          $x++;
        }
        ?>
    

Output:

        The number is: 1
        The number is: 2
        The number is: 3
        The number is: 4
        The number is: 5
    

The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.

Syntax:


do {
code to be executed } while(condition is true);

The example below first sets a variable $x to 1 ($x = 1). Then, the do while loop will write some output, and then increment the variable $x with 1. Then the condition is checked (is $x less than, or equal to 5?), and the loop will continue to run as long as $x is less than, or equal to 5:

        <?php

        /* if statement*/
        $x = 1;

        do {
          echo "The number is: $x 
";
          $x++;
        } while ($x > 5);
        ?>
    
Output:

        The number is: 1
