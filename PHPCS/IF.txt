In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

1) if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
2) if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.
3) if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
4) switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

Example: The if statement executes some code if one condition is true. 

Syntax :


if(condition) {
code to be executed if conditionis true
}



        <?php

        /* if statement*/
        $t = date("H");
        
        if ($t < "20") {
          echo "Have a good day!";
        }
        ?>

        ?> 
    

Output:

        Have a good day!
    
The if...else statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.


PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement

Output "Have a good morning!" if the current time is less than 10, and "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20. Otherwise it will output "Have a good night!":

        <?php

        /* if statement*/
        $t = date("H");
        
        if ($t < "10") {
          echo "Have a good morning!";
        } elseif ($t < "20") {
          echo "Have a good day!";
        } else {
          echo "Have a good night!";
        }
    ?>
    

Output:

        Have a good day!
