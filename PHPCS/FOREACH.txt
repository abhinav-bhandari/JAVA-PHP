foreach ($array as $value){
code to be executed if conditionis true
}



For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.


The following example will output the values of the given array ($colors):

        <?php

        /* if statement*/
        $colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");

        foreach ($colors as $value) {
          echo "$value 
";
        }
        ?>
    
Output:

        red
        green
        blue
        yellow
