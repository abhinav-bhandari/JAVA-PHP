A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.

PHP has a huge collection of internal or built-in functions that you can call directly within your PHP scripts to perform a specific task, like gettype(), print_r(), var_dump, etc.

Example: Simple program to print “Hello world!” message on the screen.

        
            <?php

            /* echo is a print command */
            echo "Hello world!"; 
    
            ?> 
        
       
    
Output:

        Hello world!
