You can specify parameters when you define your function to accept input values at run time. The parameters work like placeholder variables within a function; they're replaced at run time by the values (known as argument) provided to the function at the time of invocation.

    
        function myFunc($oneParameter, $anotherParameter){
            // Code to be executed
        }
    
You can define as many parameters as you like. However for each parameter you specify, a corresponding argument needs to be passed to the function when it is called.

The getSum() function in following example takes two integer values as arguments, simply add them together and then display the result in the browser.

    
        <?php
        // Defining function
            function getSum($num1, $num2){
            $sum = $num1 + $num2;
            echo "Sum of the two numbers $num1 and $num2 is : $sum";
            }
            // Calling function
            getSum(10, 20);
        ?>
    
Ouput:

        Sum of the two numbers 10 and 20 is : 30
